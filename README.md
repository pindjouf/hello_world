# 👋 Hello, World! in Verilog

## Overview

This repo is my playground for printing "Hello, World!" in Verilog 💻, as I prep to echo it via [UART](https://github.com/pindjouf/uart).

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Outputs "Hello, World!" one character at a time.
- ⏰ Clock-driven transitions.
- 🔄 Reset functionality.
- 🧪 Testbench for simulation included!

## 🖥️ Example Output

When running the testbench, you'll see each character of the "Hello, World!" string output one by one on each clock cycle. Example:

```
Time: 20, Letter: H
Time: 40, Letter: e
Time: 60, Letter: l
Time: 80, Letter: l
Time: 100, Letter: o
Time: 120, Letter: ,
Time: 140, Letter:  
Time: 160, Letter: W
Time: 180, Letter: o
Time: 200, Letter: r
Time: 220, Letter: l
Time: 240, Letter: d
Time: 260, Letter: !
```
